## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repository is meant to be a home for musings on medical imaging foundation models. A high level overview of early thoughts can be found [here](https://github.com/theradiographyproject/manifesto/blob/main/README.md). Over time, these musings may grow and turn into formal experiments that will also be documented here.

### Why the name "theradiographyproject"?

There are a lot of differences between the natural images computer vision has traditionally focused on versus medical imaging (RGB versus black and white, 2D versus 3D, etc.). However, a big factor that I don't see discussed as often is [photographer bias](https://github.com/theradiographyproject/manifesto/blob/main/README.md#the-role-of-photographer-bias-in-traditional-computer-vision-and-its-absence-in-medical-imaging), or the lack thereof. This difference has been central to a lot of my thoughts on medical image foundational models, particularly for cross-sectional imaging and I wanted to highlight this aspect.

### Why foundation models?




### Why do you think this is worth publishing publically?

It's likely not. But publishing is cheap and I believe in the idea that [science is a strong link problem](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/science-is-a-strong-link-problem). In the likely probability that these ideas are useless, this will just be a few wasted megabytes that Github kindly hosted for me for free. In the small probability that it helps me organize my thoughts or it inspires new research directions for others, then those megabytes will be worth it.

### Why a github repo?

- **Build in public:** I want to stake my opinions and have people be able to see the things that were done wrong as well as the things that were done right. I see github's version control and branching as a natural mechanism for people to track the journey of a project rather than just the final result.
- **Collaboration:** If people are inspired by a project there should be a low friction mechanism to contribute or build something on top of it. Github makes this easy with pull requests to contribute to the project and forking to take the ideas and build something new.
- **Flexibility/Interactivity:** Instead of being locked into pdfs, data and concepts can be shared as notebooks and demo websites which can be much more effective in conveying information.
