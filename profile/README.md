## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repository is meant to be a home for musings on medical imaging foundation models.

Why the name?

There are a lot of differences between the natural images computer vision has traditionally focused on versus medical imaging: RGB versus black and white, 2D versus 3D, etc. However, a big factor that I don't see discussed as often is [photographer bias](https://github.com/theradiographyproject/manifesto/blob/main/README.md#the-role-of-photographer-bias-in-traditional-computer-vision-and-its-absence-in-medical-imaging), or the lack thereof. This difference has been central to a lot of my thoughts on medical image foundational models, particularly for cross-sectional imaging and I wanted to highlight this aspect.

Why foundation models?



Why do you think this is worth publishing publically?

It's likely not. But publishing is cheap and I believe in the idea that [science is a strong link problem](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/science-is-a-strong-link-problem). In the likely probability that these ideas are useless, this will just be a few wasted megabytes that Github kindly hosted for me for free. In the small probability that it helps me organize my thoughts or it inspires new research directions for others, then those megabytes will be worth it.

Why a github repo?

- Perfect place to build in public
- Great way to host both docs
